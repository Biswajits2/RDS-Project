## Real-time SDR for mono/stereo FM and RDS

The main objective of the project is to navigate a complex speciﬁcation and develop an understanding of the challenges that must be addressed for a real-time implementation of a computing system operating in a form factor-constrained environment. 

The project description is available in the project [document](doc/3dy4-project-2024.pdf). The unique constraints for each group for different modes of operation (i.e., custom sample rates) are available [here](doc/3dy4-constraints-group-61.pdf).

All the project source code must be submitted before 7 p.m. on March 28. The project cross-examinations and oral presentations will run in the week of April 1, and the detailed final project report is due before 7 p.m. on April 5. 

## End of Project Update
- Mono and Stereo work completely on the PI with live data.
- RDS -> Attempted to implement RDS have the code up until but not including Frame Synchronization.
- To test RDS lines 643 to 646 and line 651 should be uncommented. Lines 638 to 641 and line 650 must be commented.
